# Why i'm not giving support to SQL Buddy anymore?

First of all, most of the code was written by Calvin Lough back in 2011. He did a really nice work, but nowadays, it surely contains code not optimized and unsafe.

This version was tested in php 7.4 and seems working fine, but i suggest migrating to another up-to-date solution.
